# Frontend Mentor - Social media dashboard with theme switcher

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest (_'Newbie'_) to hardest (_'Advanced'_).

## The challenge
__Challenge #11__<br>
__Difficulty: Junior__

This challenge was to build out a Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My approach
I started by building out the basic __HTML__ page structure, making sure the page layout made sense at a fundamental level, particularly for screenreader users.

I've used Sass in previous projects but this was my first time experimenting with __CSS variables__. I used them and some vanilla __Javascript__ to implement the theme-switching feature.

I paid particular attention to making sure I was implementing the toggle itself in an accessible way.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-henna-three.vercel.app/

## Shoutouts
Since this was my first foray into CSS variables and theme switching, I did a fair bit of reading before tackling the problem. In particular, I leaned heavily on these smart folks:
